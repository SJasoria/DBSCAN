### Usage

Input Format: 

N D K e MinPts   
N: Number of data points  
D: Dimension of data points  
e: Radius of neighbourhood for a point (e <= K)  
MinPts: Minimum number of points in the given neighbourhood (MinPts <= K)  
This is followed by N lines of D dimensioned data points  

On terminal, execute the following command

```racket driver.rkt t0.in > t0.out```

Three sample input output files are present for reference.
